What have you got planned for today?

Ross: (entering) Hey! 

Chandler: Hey! 

Monica: What are you doing here? 

Ross: I don’t know.

Phoebe: How do you feel? 

Ross: (Sighing.) It was...This disagreement over...How this is not a marriage! 

Chandler: I'm sorry. 

Rachel: (entering) Hey! 

Chandler: Oh my God...

Ross: Oh no!

Rachel: Oh my God! What is it with you? 

Ross: I would not be able to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once you betray me, I am pretending. 

Rachel: Well, the first time is a little bit mischievous!

Ross: Oh, are you going to be a little steep? 

Rachel: (Angrily) Yeah, but I don't want to be a little steep. 

Ross: Yeah, whoosh! (Imitates a little extravagant)

Monica: Ehh, I mean it was a little steep. 

Chandler: I don’t know, I don't think so. 

Monica: Oh my God! 

Chandler: All right, I think it's a little steep.

Monica: That is what I said.

Joey: Wow! This is awkward.

Rachel: Oh my God! You are pure evil. (storms out)

Monica: What are you gonna do? 

Ross: I don't know. Oh my God, I wrecked it!

Phoebe: I don’t know, I think it's gonna be like this right now. 

Chandler: I don't think so. 

Ross: Noooo. I don't know. 

Monica: What are you gonna do? 

Ross: I don’t know. 

Chandler: All right,come on, you don't have to be a 'nice guy,' OK? 

Ross: Aww... (They hug) 

Chandler: (straining) Okay.
