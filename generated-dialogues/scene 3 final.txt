Monica: (With a confused look on his face.) What are you doing with those?! 

Chandler: Are you kidding?! 

Joey: What the hell is that?!!

Chandler: That’s-that’s my nubbin. Oh my God!

Joey: Well, I guess now I know what the hell that is! What do you feel? 

Chandler: (panicked) Er.... um..... I don't know.

Monica: Will you go to the hospital?

Chandler: You betcha! 

Monica: Yeah, we have to go to the hospital. 

Chandler: So you know what I want?

Monica: I don't know. I mean, you want me to do it all the time. 

Chandler: Yeah, if you want to caress my butt...

Monica: Are you kidding?! No. 

Chandler: Well, you know what I have to hide. 

Monica: I got the decisions, and I have a barrel. 

Ross: Oh my god.

Phoebe: Hey.

Monica: Hey! 

Chandler: Hey! 

Phoebe: I’m gonna create a positive atmosphere… 

Chandler: Okay. 

Monica: (louder) A positive atmosphere! Oh my god.
